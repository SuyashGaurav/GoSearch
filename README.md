## Project Description
- GoSearch is a web application built using React.js and Tailwind CSS that serves as a clone of the Google search engine. It fetches search results and image results using the Google Search API via RapidAPI and displays them on the web page.
- It allows users to search the web and view search results, just like they would on the real Google website.

- You can access the live demo of GoSearch [here](https://gosearch-suyash-gaurav.netlify.app/).

## Deployment
The project is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed live at [https://gosearch-suyash-gaurav.netlify.app/](https://gosearch-suyash-gaurav.netlify.app/).
